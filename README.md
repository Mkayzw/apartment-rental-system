# Wisdom Ojimah's Final Year Project

## Intro

The aim of this work is to ease the process of searching for suitable accomodation. This work consists of a general hompage where prospective tenants can go through listings of available accomodation. They can also search for accomodation based on the price range, location, and type of accomodation. This README would be updated as I complete different sections of this project.

- Implemented the search for property feature. Users have the option to either enable strict search which would make sure the search results match exactly with what they're expecting or they can disable strict search which would make sure that the search results contain the search term. There are also certain fields such as property type, location of the property, and price range that can be used to narrow down the search results.

- Implemented the contact property owner feature for individual apartments (the form to signify interest for an apartment)
