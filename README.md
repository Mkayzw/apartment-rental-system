# Wisdom Ojimah's Final Year Project

## Intro

The aim of this work is to ease the process of searching for situatable accomodation. This work consists of a general hompage where prospective tenants can go through listings of available accomodation. They can also search for accomodation based on the price range, location, and type of accomodation. This README would be updated as I complete different sections of this project.
